# Calculator
The objective for this project was to create a calculator application as described in the project prompt. Currently, this copy of the project simply displays "Hello world". It was developed in Android Studio and tested using a Nexus 5x emulator. 

If an error is displayed claiming the app-debug.apk file is not installed, click the "Sync Project with Gradle Files" button in the Android Studio IDE.
